# PyBer_Analysis

# Overview of the analysis
This challenge displays the ride-sharing differ by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer. 

## The purpose of the new analysis
During this challenge, I created a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type Using using Python skills and knowledge of Pandas. With many different types of graph including plots, bar chart, and pie chart, the analysis provides the difference came from. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, I created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type which is more clear and visible for people who want to understand the summary results.

# Results: There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type
- Fares differ from various type of cities
  - The mean of fare in rural is around $36 while the mean fare in urban is approximately $24.
  - The range of fares is from 15 to 45 in urban cities whilst the range of fares is from about 10 to 45 for urban cities.

  - The total number of rides is the least in rural cities and the most in urban cities.
  - The mean of rides in urban are around 37 but the mean of rural rides are 4. This is a dramatical difference.
  - The range of rides number in suburban is between 9 to 27 which is the median. The rides number range is wider in urban which is from 12 to 38 and the range in rural is 3 to 12.

conclusion: 
 - Fares tend to be higher in the rural cities compared to the urban cities and fares in suburban cities is between rural and urban.
 - Less rides results to higher fares.
 - There are less population in rural cities and the distance of rural might be longer than urban cities. Thus, there are less rides in rural cities.

# Summary
## here is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types
- The total fares in rural cities are the lowest and urban cities are highest. Running business in urban cities could help to make more profits.
- Even though there are more rides in urban cities, but the average fares are still higher than fares in rural cities. This could be another support for the suggestion above.
- Suburban cities is in the median for both average/total fares or average/total rides. It could be a potential area to develop business. 
- Business in rural cities is not recommended as the average fares are too high and people may want to avoid the expenses.
- It looks like the fares in January tend to be slightly lower than February, March and April. Thus, I would recommend not to have business in January. Instead, the fares tend to be higher in end of February before March. End of February could be a better option than other months.
